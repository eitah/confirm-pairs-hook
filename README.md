# This Post-commit hook is meant to confirm pairs.

Find me on NPM at https://www.npmjs.com/package/pairs-hook
Find me on GIT at https://github.com/eitah/pairs-hook/

It assumes that all pairs in pair files only have two letter initials.

Simply run it with npm start wire it in as a post commit hook.

It will not run your tests twice because of the -n modifier.
